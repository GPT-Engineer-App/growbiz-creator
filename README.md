# growbiz-creator

Create a website for my business.
Business model: Our business develops websites and online stores for small local businesses. We cold call the business that has no website or online store and propose that we build one for them. I have 2 years of data analyst/operation excellence experience and have a passion for helping small business grow and develop.
In the future, once the business develops, we would like to add in the process of creating apps for these business and also performing business optimisation and consultancy for businesses.
